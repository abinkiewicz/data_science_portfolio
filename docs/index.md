# Welcome to my portfolio!

I have a background in Mechatronics and a Master’s in Production and Management Engineering.
For the past few years, I’ve worked in industrial robotics, but my curiosity has led me toward Data Science. I work on data projects that explore how data can help solve everyday problems - sometimes even ones I notice by observing my animals. I am especially drawn to ideas that make life easier, more accessible, and thoughtful. I really enjoy learning - always something new, always with purpose. 

Because sometimes, data really does create magic ✨
